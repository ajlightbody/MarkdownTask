There are four very useful actions that need to be learned to use git successfully. These are:

1. Push
2. Pull
3. Commit
4. Clone

| Action        | Frequency of use           | Command line git bash command  |
| :------------ |:-------------:|:-----:|
| Push     |Frequently. Push multiple committed pieces at work.   |git push  |
| Pull      |Frequently. Always pull before pushing.      |git pull   |
| Commit |Most frequently. Commit each finished piece of work before pushing.      |git commit -m "[commit message]"   |
| Clone   | Once, at the start of project. |git clone ssh://git@github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git |
